# Faculty Data CRUD Manager

# 1. Problem Statement
Managing faculty information manually using paper records or basic spreadsheets often leads to errors, duplication, difficulty in searching, and time-consuming updates.  
There is no simple system available to quickly add new faculty details, view all records, edit existing information, or remove outdated data in one place.  

A small, user-friendly application is needed to store and manage faculty data efficiently.

The scope includes:  
- A GUI interface for entering, viewing, updating, and deleting faculty information  
- A backend SQLite database to store data permanently  
- Basic validation of user inputs  
- Display of records in a table format  
- Modular Python code for easy maintenance

- Input validation to prevent incorrect entries  
- Success and error messages for better user feedback  
- Persistent storage using SQLite database

# 5. Author
This project has been developed by me as part of a coursework assignment to practice basic software development concepts. 
The focus was on understanding how GUI applications work, how CRUD operations are handled using a database, and how to structure code in a clean and modular way. 
The project reflects the my learning and exploration of Python, Tkinter, and SQLite while building a simple but functional data management tool.
